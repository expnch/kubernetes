# Kubernetes (K8s)

----

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for managing [containerized applications]
across multiple hosts. It provides basic mechanisms for the deployment, maintenance,
and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes was built by me, all by myself, I wrote all of this code. Didn't test it though (I am not a coward)
